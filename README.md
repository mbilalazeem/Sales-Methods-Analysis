# Sales-Methods-Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of different sales methods utilized by a business to optimize revenue generation from existing customers. The study includes data cleaning, validation, visualization, and statistical testing, providing insights into the effectiveness of different sales methods in terms of revenue and the number of units sold.

## Project Overview

This project aims to help the business identify the most effective sales method to increase revenue from existing customers. The dataset used in this analysis consists of data regarding sales methods, customer behavior, and revenue. 

The sales methods include: 
- Call
- Email
- Email + Call

## Key Files in the Repository

- `Workbook.ipynb`: Detailed report on the data analysis, including the methodology, results, and recommendations. 
- `Task.pdf`: The task I was doing 

## Key Findings

- The "Email + Call" sales method appears to be the most effective, generating the highest revenue.
- There are significant differences in the number of units sold and revenue between different sales methods, with the combination of email and call being the most effective.
- The number of site visits and the number of units sold have moderate to strong positive correlations with revenue.

## Business Questions Answered:
The analysis and reporting provided in this project seek to answer the following business-critical questions:

- Data Quality and Validation: What is the state of our data, and what steps were taken to validate and clean it?
- Customer Distribution: How are our customers distributed across the different sales methods we employ?
- Revenue Distribution: How is our revenue distributed overall and per sales method?
- Sales Method Impact: What is the impact of each sales method on the number of units sold and the revenue generated?
- Comparison of Sales Methods: Are there significant differences in the number of units sold and revenue generated by different sales methods?
- Revenue Trends: How has the revenue evolved over time for each of our sales methods?
- Strategic Recommendation: Based on the findings of the data analysis, which sales method is recommended for maximizing revenue?

These key questions help us understand the effectiveness of our sales methods and provide data-driven insights for strategic decision-making to optimize sales and increase revenue.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis conducted, the "Email + Call" sales method should be the primary method used moving forward. This approach strikes a balance between effort and revenue, with the highest revenue generated among the three methods while only requiring a relatively short call to each customer.
