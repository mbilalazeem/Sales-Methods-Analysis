I have validated all the columns against the criteria in the dataset table:\n\n- Week: Week has 6 values without missing values, from 1 to 6. No cleaning is needed.\n\n- sales_method: 5 sales methods, 2 of them seemed the same \"email\" and \"Email\" was just a typing error, and so were \"em + call\" and \"email + call\", so after doing the replacement, 3 unique values remained. No missing value in the column.\n\n- customer_id: 1500 customer ids, all stored in the \"object\" data type as it had alphanumeric values, and all were unique, with no missing value. No cleaning is needed.\n\n- nb_sold: number of new products sold has 10 values, ranging from 7 to 16. It was in the \"object\" data type, but as all of them were integers, so were converted to integers. No missing values\n\n- revenue: revenue from the sales had 6743 unique values, had a float data type which was fine as it should be rounder to 2 decimal places, but it had 1074 missing values. The values were checked, and against the number of item sold, So there were no values where revenue was 0 because the customer didnt bought instead it is missing values as all of it has nb_sold on them. Missing data can lead to a lack of precision in the statistical analysis. So were removed. After removal the total rows were left to 13926.\n\n- years_as_customer: number of years customer has been buying from us had 42 unique values ranging from 0 to 63. The company was founded in 1984, and assuming this data was updated till 2022 the maximum years a customer could have been would be 38 so removing the data with values above 38. After removal the total rows were left to 13922.\n\n- nb_site_visits: number of times the customer has visited our website has 26 unique values, ranging from 12 to 37, the data type of the column is integer, which is also correct. No cleaning is needed.\n\n- state: location of the customer has 50 values, all of them are US states in text strings and so the data type object is fine. No cleaning is needed.\n\nAfter the data validation, the dataset contains **13922 rows and 8 columns** without missing values.\n\n### My conclusion\n\n- The data validation process has helped to identify and correct errors and inconsistencies in the original dataset.\n- After the validation process, the dataset now contains 13,922 rows and 8 columns without missing values.\n- The removal of missing data in the revenue column may improve the precision of the statistical analysis that will be conducted on the dataset.\n- The removal of data with values above 38 in the years_as_customer column may help to ensure that the dataset is accurate and realistic.\n- Correcting the inconsistency in the sales_method column helps to ensure that the data is clean and accurate and will prevent potential errors in the analysis.\n- Overall, the data validation process has improved the quality and accuracy of the dataset and will help to ensure that any statistical analysis conducted on the dataset is reliable and accurate.\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ac1cbd94-4fd4-4687-b8a1-58ef7b0c0a56"},{"source":"## How many customers were there for each approach?\nFrom the data provided to us, we found that there were total 13922 customers, there were 4,780 customers who used the Call sales method, 6,919 customers who used the Email sales method, and 2,223 customers who used the Email + Call sales method.\n\n\nBased on these numbers, we can see that Email sales method was the most popular approach among customers, followed by the Call sales method. The Email + Call  approach had the fewest number of customers.\n\n\n![number of customers for each sales_method1](number%20of%20customers%20for%20each%20sales_method1.png)\n\n\n## Understanding the variables \n\n### Checking the count of customers in each method\n\n![single variable - count of customers per sales method1](single%20variable%20-%20count%20of%20customers%20per%20sales%20method1.png)\n\nThis bar chart represents the count of customers for each sales method.

The x-axis shows the different states, while the y-axis shows the count of customers. The bar chart provides an overview of the distribution of customers across different states, showing California has the highest customer count followed by texas and so, lasting at north dakota.\n\n\n## What does the spread of the revenue look like overall? And for each method?\n\nAfter this the violin plot was plotted to observe the distribution of revenue for each sales method. \nby seeing the violon plot below, it can be concluded that the \"Email + Call\" sales method has the highest median revenue and the highest IQR, indicating that this sales method is more effective at generating higher revenue than the other sales methods, but it also has higher variability in revenue. The \"Call\" sales method has the lowest median revenue and the lowest IQR, indicating that it generates lower revenue compared to the other sales methods, but it also has less variability in revenue. The \"Email\" sales method has a higher median revenue than \"Call\" but a lower median revenue than \"Email + Call\", and it has a higher IQR than \"Call\", indicating that it generates moderate revenue and has more variability in revenue compared to \"Call\".\n\nFrom a business perspective, these insights can be useful for the sales team to optimize their sales strategies. For instance, if the sales team wants to focus on generating higher revenue, they may consider adopting the \"Email + Call\" sales method, while if they want to ensure a more stable revenue stream, they may focus on the \"Call\" sales method. Additionally, if the sales team wants to expand their sales reach, they can consider using a combination of \"Email\" and \"Call\" methods, which has the potential to generate higher revenue, but may also have higher variability.\n\n![violin plot for sales method1](violin%20plot%20for%20sales%20method1.png)\n\nI then investigated how the sales method affects the number of units sold or revenue.\nThe stacked bar chart below shows that number of units sold and revenue generated for each sales method, where \"Call\" sold 9.5 units and generated 47.6 in revenue, \"Email\" sold 9.7 units and generated 97.1 in revenue, and \"Email + Call\" sold 12.2 units and generated 183.7 in revenue. This suggests that the \"Email + Call\" sales method was the most effective in terms of both units sold and revenue generated, followed by \"Email\", and then \"Call\".\n\n![average units sold and revenue by sales method1](average%20units%20sold%20and%20revenue%20by%20sales%20method1.png)\n\n\nI also investigated the relationship between each variables by making the heatmap, it seems that the variables \"week\" and \"years_as_customer\" have weak or no correlation with the other variables, while \"nb_sold\", \"revenue\", and \"nb_site_visits\" have moderate to strong positive correlations with each other. \n\n![correlation matrix1](correlation%20matrix1.png)\n\nThe a pairwise t-tests was done comparing the number of units sold and revenue between different sales methods.\n\nThe results indicate that there are significant differences in the number of units sold and revenue between different sales methods. Specifically, the p-values for all the t-tests are less than 0.05, which indicates that the differences are statistically significant.\n\nComparing call vs. email, call appears to be more effective in terms of the number of units sold and revenue. When call is used in addition to email, there is a significant increase in the effectiveness of the sales method.\n\nLater the t-statistic for both the number of units sold and the number of site visits are both significantly different from zero, with very low p-values. This suggests that there is a strong relationship between these variables and the number of units sold and revenue.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"43b371d0-e489-49a0-8d56-19838666a77d"},{"source":"## Was there any difference in revenue over time for each of the methods?\n\nPlots were made to check the relationship of each sales method over time with number of items bought per week, revenue generated per week and customers per week\n\n#### Email \nFrom the graph, it appears that the number of customers and the number of items sold decreased over time, indicating a potential decrease in interest or effectiveness of the Email sales method. The revenue generated also decreased over time, which suggests that the decrease in customer and item count was not compensated by higher prices or more expensive items being sold. \nin the third week more customers were dealt with than in the fourth week, but the nb_sold and revenue were lower; it is possible that in the third week, customers may have purchased lower-value items compared to customers in the fourth week.\n\n### Call\nFrom the graph, it appears that the revenue and number of items sold increased gradually over the first five weeks, but then there was a significant drop in sales during the sixth week. The numbers were in the middle of week one and week 6, but the number of customers dealt with was also nearly half than they were in the first week. \nThe decrease in the number of customers dealt with during the sixth week could have been a contributing factor, as it suggests that the sales team may not have been working as hard to make sales during that time; it can also be that customers bought high valued items that week and probably has caused the team to relax, hence not dealing with the appropriate number of customers. However, it is also possible that external factors, such as changes in the market or competition, could have played a role in the decrease in sales.\n\n\n### Call + Email\nLooking at the graph of Email + Call sales method, we can see that the number of customers, number of items sold, and revenue all increased from week 1 to week 5. However, there was a decrease in all three measures in week 6.\n\nIn particular, the number of customers dealt with decreased by about 28% from week 5 to week 6, while the number of items sold and revenue both decreased by about 13%. This suggests that the decrease in revenue may be due to a combination of both fewer customers and lower sales per customer.\n\nIt's possible that there were external factors that affected sales in week 6, such as a holiday or other event that caused people to be less interested in making purchases. Alternatively, it could be that the sales team was less effective in converting leads to sales during that week.\n\nOverall, this data suggests that the Email + Call sales method was generally effective in generating revenue, but that there may be room for improvement in terms of consistency from week to week.\n\n\n![revenue by each sales_method1](revenue%20by%20each%20sales_method1.png)\n![number of items by each sales_method1](number%20of%20items%20by%20each%20sales_method1.png)\n![Customers over time by sales method1](Customers%20over%20time%20by%20sales%20method1.png)\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bc6cd440-1796-4ac1-85cd-f5a445bd315e"},{"source":"## Recommendation\nBased on the analysis conducted, my recommendation is that the \"Email + Call\" sales method should be the primary method used moving forward. This approach strikes a balance between effort and revenue, with the highest revenue generated among the three methods while only requiring a relatively short call to each customer.\n\nThe business goal of this project is to increase revenue from existing customers through more effective sales methods. The data analyzed clearly shows that the current sales methods are not optimized for revenue generation. However, by implementing the \"Email + Call\" method, the business can expect to see an increase in revenue from existing customers.\n\nThe analysis conducted has addressed the business problem of suboptimal revenue generation from existing customers. By identifying the weaknesses in the existing sales methods and evaluating the effectiveness of different approaches, the analysis has provided a clear recommendation for improving revenue generation.\n\nTo measure the success of this recommendation, the business can track the total revenue generated from existing customers on a monthly or quarterly basis. By comparing the revenue generated after implementing the \"Email + Call\" method to the revenue generated previously, the business can determine the effectiveness of the new approach.\n\nTo provide a baseline measure for this problem, I have evaluated the revenue generated by each sales method and compared them to the total revenue from existing customers. This provides a clear picture of the effectiveness of each method and highlights the potential for improvement through the implementation of the \"Email + Call\" method.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ebae498a-f329-4828-adf5-e8bade4439ff"},{"source":"## ✅ When you have finished...\n-  Publish your Workspace using the option on the left\n-  Check the published version of your report:\n\t-  Can you see everything you want us to grade?\n    -  Are all the graphics visible?\n-  Review the grading rubric.
